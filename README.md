This is a demo app to show case redux with Next.js.

A simple Next.js API was made reading/writing data from/to a json file to demonstrate async thunks in redux.

Chakra UI was used for styling.

The `main` branch utilizes redux toolkit. Switch to `vanilla-redux` branch to see what this code would look like without utilizing redux toolkit.

Run `npm run dev` to see the app in action.
